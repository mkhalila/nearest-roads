# nearest-roads
This is a standard Node module to retrieve a list of the nearest roads from OpenStreetMaps, given:
1. latitude
2. longitude
3. distance in metres

The data is then parsed to abstract away some of the less relevant data returned from OpenStreetMap.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
